            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <span class="square"></span>
            <p>Hello everyone, my name is Salsabila Najrifatussya'diah, usually called caca or salsa. 
                I come from the city of Karawang, and now I am a 6th semester student. My hobbies are listening to music, reading books, 
                watching and writing. I like to write because for me writing is not an easy matter of choosing words to create a nuance, 
                but more than that there is a responsibility for what I write can change someone's life. Maybe it could also be said that
                writing is not my hobby but my desire. Because in this life I want to make memories, and my teacher once said 
                â€œIf you want to be remembered, then write, if you want to be forgotten, then be silent. 
                Through your work, even though you are no longer in this world, your name will be eternal with what you write.<br>

            <h4>@katasabil</h4>
            <p>@katasabil is my Instagram account for sharing stories and some words, both motivational and random words. 
                At first I wrote maybe just to follow the trend. But at one point I realized that writing is not only about popularity, 
                that writing is not only about how much my work is read, nor how well my work sells out. For me, writing about how meaningful 
                the writing that I make can leave an impression on the hearts of readers. Even if it's only one sentence, if it can make him feel 
                better why not? There are not a few Best seller books that end up gathering dust in the corner of the cupboard, 
                and there aren't many cheap books that are neatly arranged in the hearts of readers.
